# Mini Project 3 Assignment
For this mini project, your team is assigned a research task
where you have to **find a free bug tracking/issue tracking tool
that integrates with Eclipse** and allows collaborative team work
(e.g. Git plugin on Eclipse, where everyone in the team can see everything).

1. You will have to write a short report **explaining** the tool **features**,
   where to **download** it, how to **install** it,
   and **a user manual** on how to use it.
2. You will also need to **make a tutorial video**
   that shows "dummies" how to make it work!

## What's to Come
This README will end up being replaced with said user manual (_probably_
written in Markdown) and include a link to the video. Keep an eye out!
