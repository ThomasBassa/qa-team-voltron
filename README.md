# Team Voltron's SE 420 GitHub Repository
Maintained by Thomas Bassa, Gregory Carkin, Umar Idris, and Michael Philotoff

This is the work we've done for SE 420, Software Quality Assurance,
a course part of the Software Engineering program at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

## Project Usage
1. Clone the repository into a new folder within your Eclipse workspace.
2. Make a new Java project in Eclipse with the same folder name
   (or point Eclipse to the same folder otherwise)
3. You should be able to use everything from Eclipse.
4. The Git related actions can be seen in the `Team...` sub-menu
   when you right click on the new project.

Alternatively, you can use the import menu to both clone the repo and add
the project. Be careful as to where you tell the wizard where to clone it.

New projects should be added as sub-folders, which should be subsequently added
to the build path of the Eclipse project. The existing projects are already
handled by the `.classpath` file.

## Importing Issues into Eclipse
