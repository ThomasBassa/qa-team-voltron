# Team Voltron's SE 420 GitHub Repository
Maintained by Thomas Bassa, Gregory Carkin, Umar Idris, and Michael Philotoff

This is the work we've done for SE 420, Software Quality Assurance,
a course part of the Software Engineering program at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

## Project Usage
1. Clone the repository into a new folder within your Eclipse workspace.
2. Make a new Java project in Eclipse with the same folder name
   (or point Eclipse to the same folder otherwise)
3. You should be able to use everything from Eclipse.
4. The Git related actions can be seen in the `Team...` submenu
   when you right click on the new project.
5. GitHub issues integration will be covered soon...

New projects should be added as subfolders, which should be subquently added
to the build path of the Eclipse project. Spit builds to the `bin` subfolder,
which will be ignored by Git. This should already be set up.
